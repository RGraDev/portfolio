            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am currently a technical consultant implementing data solutions for customers, 
                and am now embarking on my journey as a Junior Software Developer.</p>
            <p>From my university days studying economics I picked up some coding experience, and also
                have some experience using JavaScript, which I gained up in my role as a technical consultant.</p>
